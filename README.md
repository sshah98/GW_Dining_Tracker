# GW Dining Tracker

##The goal is to provide a way for students to input their current balance. The program will track user spending with input of the place they bought and the money they spent

(will need to be changed later because many students don't actually get receipts or care how much money they spent at one time)

The application starts off with the input value of the current balance of the student

###_Done_:

-   CSV file contains vendor information (name, address, website, and filters inc. veg friendly, deliver, late night)
-   CSV file containing prices of every transaction in one's get history from present day to 6 months ago
-   python file scrapes GET-Cbord website for data, puts into DataFrame and then plots line with regression

###_To Do_:
1. Focus on predicting by date, when dining dollars will run out 
2. See what other statistical analysis and information can be understood from the data

-   Intermediary steps here

3.  Implement into a Django REST API so that other people can start accessing their information
